# Analyzing Trends in Programming Language Popularity

Discover the trends in the popularity of programming languages by answering the following questions:

### 1. Analyze R-Tagged Questions Over Time
- Analyze the number of questions tagged with **R** each year compared to the total number of questions across all tags per year.
- Save the result in a data frame, `r_over_time`, containing the following columns:
  - `year`: The year of the data.
  - `tag`: The tag of the programming language (e.g., "R").
  - `num_questions`: The number of questions tagged with R.
  - `year_total`: The total number of questions across all tags per year.
  - `percentage`: The percentage of questions tagged with R out of the total questions per year.

### 2. Calculate R-Tagged Question Percentage in 2020
- Calculate the percentage of all questions in **2020** that were tagged with **R**.
- Save your answer as a numeric variable, `r_percentage`, expressed as a decimal.

### 3. Identify Top Programming Language Tags (2015-2020)
- Identify the five programming language tags with the highest total number of questions asked between **2015** and **2020**.
- Save the tag names as a character vector, `highest_tags`.

### 4. Determine Largest Year-Over-Year Increase
- Identify which tag experienced the largest year-over-year increase in its percentage of questions.
- Save the tag name answer as a character vector, `highest_ratio_tag`.

### Bonus: Visualize the Data!
- Try visualizing the data along the way to gain deeper insights into the trends.
